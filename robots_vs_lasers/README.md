# Reference Implementation for PuzzleNode #4

## Run the script

    $ ruby bin/robotic data/sample-input.txt
    GO WEST
    GO EAST
    GO WEST

## Run the tests

    $ ruby test/suite.rb

Note: you need minitest >= 2.2.2. This is built into Ruby 1.9.3, but on Ruby
1.9.2 or earlier, you will need to install the gem version of minitest. Running
`bundle install` or `gem install minitest` should do the trick.
