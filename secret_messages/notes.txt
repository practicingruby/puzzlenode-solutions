Tempted to provide a mock dictionary file, but YAGNI? (could have been an
alternate way to deal with performance)

Time spent on test boilerplate noticeably tedious and boring. Hard to maintain

Seekrit::Cracker has dependencies, would people seriously mock in this
situation?  Also... explicitly mentioning 0..25 in Cracker legit?
